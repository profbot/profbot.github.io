# My Megathread: Cool Tools


### Downloading/Scraping

I enjoy datahoarding and archiving and I use a great many tools to do that. Most if not all are open-source.

 - [Go-InternetArchive](https://github.com/nektro/go-internetarchive) - A command line tool to download files from the Internet Archive. `GO` `COMMAND LINE`

 - [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl) - A python-based tool to download photos/albums from a bunch of supported sites, which you can view [here](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.rst).
