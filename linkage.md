### FAQ

**What Is a TD?**

A TD or team drive/shared drive is a drive attached to your own google drive which has the following features:
 - Unlimited Storage Space
 - A 400,000 file amount limit in a single team drive. Folders count towards this limit.
 - A maximum of 5TB in a single file
**User Limits**:
 - 750GB upload per user/per day but if you hit the limit during upload, it will let you finish uploading the file up to 5TB. If you start uploading another file, it will error out with a message about upload quota cap.
 - A 10TB Download amount per day.
  

As you can see, TDs are pretty amazing right?


**How Do You Make TDs?**

Well, it's not a free feature, so these free TDs are from the EDU version of Google Drive. So you shouldn't rely on it as permanent storage. 

However, here are some websites where you can make some free TDs:

 - [A Range Of Universities](http://td.fastio.me/)
 - [Mail.ccsf.edu](https://teamdrive.mfoxx.workers.dev/)


I do not recommend using the Enterprise or Non-Profit domains as they are much smaller or paid for, meaning the chances that they get shut down is larger. The School domains are better because:

 - They get the service for free.
 - A large amount of people are currently using this.
 - There is no current way to bulk delete these drives.
